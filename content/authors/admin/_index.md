Welcome to my website! I’m a research and data analyst, currently specializing in Data Science. I’m a Program Assistant at the All Stars Project of Chicago and a Research Collaborator at Doxa, Laboratory of Electoral Studies, Political Communication and Public Opinion at Rio de Janeiro State University. I have experience on academia, think tanks and non-profit organizations conducting research and data analysis on elections and electoral statistics, political behavior and institutions. 

I’m originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I live in Chicago, IL, with my husband and our cat, Zach Balbúrdia. When I’m not coding, I’m attending to Chicago R-Ladies meetups, drawing, painting or reading.
