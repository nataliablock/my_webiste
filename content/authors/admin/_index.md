Hi, I’m Natalia Block! I’m a research and data analyst, currently specializing in Data Science. I’m a Program Assistant at the All Stars Project of Chicago and a Research Collaborator at Doxa, Laboratory of Electoral Studies, Political Communication and Public Opinion at Rio de Janeiro State University. I have experience on academia, think tanks and non-profit organizations conducting research and data analysis on elections and electoral statistics, political behavior and institutions. 

Lately I’ve been dedicated to developing tools and resources for learning and teaching R in Portuguese. More broadly, I’ve been studying accessible ways to introduce programming and statistics to social science students and researchers from Portuguese speaking countries.

I’m originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I live in Chicago, IL, with my husband and our cat, Zach Balbúrdia. When I’m not coding, I’m attending to Chicago R-Ladies meetups, drawing, painting or reading.
